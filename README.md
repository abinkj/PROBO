The Autonomous waste collection robot represents a crucial advancement in addressing
the pressing issue of waterborne waste pollution. It employs cutting-edge technologies
like artificial intelligence (AI) and image processing to actively traverse water surfaces,
equipped with a camera system to identify floating waste efficiently. Once waste is de￾tected, the robot swiftly gathers the debris using its automated conveyor belt mechanism
and deposits it into an onboard bin for storage. An integral aspect of the system is the
integration of a mobile application developed using Flutter, offering users seamless control
over the robot’s operations. This Flutter app provides a user-friendly interface for moni￾toring the robot’s activities, initiating trash collection processes, and accessing real-time
data on waste detection and collection. Furthermore, the robot operates sustainably by
harnessing renewable solar energy, ensuring extended operation without relying on exter￾nal power sources. Its AI-driven waste detection system not only enhances navigation
efficiency but also plays a vital role in addressing the pervasive environmental challenge
of plastic pollution in water bodies. In essence, this innovative technology represents a
significant and impactful step toward preserving water ecosystems while advocating for
cost-effective and eco-conscious trash collection practices.
